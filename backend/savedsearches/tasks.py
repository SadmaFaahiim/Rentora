"""Celery tasks — saved-search AI matching (Phase 11+).

Two complementary paths, both sharing the same scored/deduped matcher:

- ``match_room_event`` — fired from a Room post-save signal: a brand-new room
  is scored against every active user's saved searches and relevant matches
  are alerted immediately; a *price change* on an existing room triggers
  price-drop alerts for matching saved searches.
- ``check_saved_searches`` — the daily beat digest (kept as a safety net):
  rooms that arrived since the last check are scored and alerted, skipping
  anything already notified (cooldown dedupe via ``Notification.meta``).

With no broker configured (local dev/CI) tasks run eagerly/synchronously;
with Redis they're fully async — matching never blocks room creation either
way (the dispatch is wrapped defensively).
