## 📋 Product Overview

|                     |                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Problem**         | Finding a trustworthy room in Dhaka is hard — listings are scattered, landlords are hard to verify, and scams are common.                                                                     |
| **Solution**        | One verified marketplace: AI-scanned listings, real-time landlord chat, secure gateway payments, roommate matching, and an ML-powered fraud engine that catches bad actors before tenants do. |
| **Target users**    | Tenants (students & young professionals) and landlords in Bangladesh.                                                                                                                         |
| **Differentiators** | Fraud-engineered trust layer, AI recommendations & fair-price insight, roommates (a growth hook competitors lack), and a monetized listing-tier system (Free → Featured → Premium).           |

## 🆕 Changelog

**Phase 9 — Operate It (Reliability & Observability)**

- **Sentry error tracking** — backend (Django/Celery integrations) and frontend (`@sentry/react`); initialised from `SENTRY_DSN` / `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` and a **no-op when unset**, so local dev and CI never send events. Frontend error boundary forwards component stacks.
- **Structured JSON logging** — a stdlib-only `JSONFormatter` (`config/logging.py`) emits one JSON object per line when `JSON_LOGS=True`; stable keys (timestamp/level/logger/message) plus caller extras, ready for any log shipper.
- **Celery + Celery Beat** — `config/celery.py` with a **zero-config local mode**: an empty `CELERY_BROKER_URL` runs tasks eagerly (synchronously, no Redis), production sets a Redis broker and tasks go async. Scheduled maintenance moved onto the beat schedule: hourly tier expiry, daily market-stat refresh, daily catalogue fraud re-scan, daily rent reminders (`rooms/pricing/fraud/payments/tasks.py`).
- **Fraud hardening** — the auto-scan now runs through a Celery task wrapped in try/except so a detector or queue failure can **never break room creation**; individual detector failures are isolated (logged + skipped, the rest still run); the flag path now also emails the landlord.
- **Branded HTML transactional emails** — `notifications/emails.py` + `notifications/templates/emails/` (base shell + OTP code, recovery codes, booking status, fraud flag, promotion expiry), each with a plain-text fallback. Wired into OTP delivery, 2FA-enable recovery codes, booking lifecycle signals, fraud flags, and `expire_listings`.
- **Audit log** — new `audit` app: an append-only `AuditLogEntry` table records who did what to which object (with IP) for sensitive actions. Wired into fraud-report review and 2FA enable/disable; the Django admin view is read-only so the trail cannot be rewritten.
- **Backup & restore runbook** — `scripts/backup_db.py` (cross-platform; SQLite consistent copy via the backup API, PostgreSQL via `pg_dump`, pruning with `--keep`) plus `docs/ops/backup-restore.md` covering restore, media, and a quarterly restore drill.
- **KYC SLA breach alerts** — a daily Celery beat task (`alert_kyc_sla_breaches`) watches the KYC review queue and alerts every admin (in-app notification + branded email) when a **breach** fires: an application stuck past 48h, or decisions this week trailing last week. Deduplicated atomically per day per condition (`get_or_create` on a date-stamped title), so a retried cron never stacks identical alerts.

**Phase 10 — Grow It (Growth & Personalization)**

- **AI recommendations v2 — Similar Rooms** — every room modal now shows a **content-based similar-rooms carousel** (`GET /recommendations/similar/<id>/`): listings ranked by area, room type, price band and amenity overlap, with a match % and explainable reasons ("Same area: Dhanmondi · Similar amenities"). Same feature vector family as the personalized recommendations, so the two surfaces agree.
- **Search v2 — full-text + typo tolerance** — room search (`?q=`) is now real full-text on **PostgreSQL** (`SearchVector`/`SearchRank` with stemming + `pg_trgm` fuzzy similarity so typos still match) with an automatic **`icontains` fallback on SQLite**, so dev/CI/prod behave identically. `?q=` still composes with area/price/gender filters and geo queries.
- **Saved searches + alerts** — the Rooms page gets a **Saved searches** bar: save the current filters (with a name), and a daily Celery beat task (`check_saved_searches`) notifies you in-app whenever a **new** matching listing appears (never re-alerts the same rooms — `last_checked_at` advances every run). Manual "check now" from the list too.
- **Browser push notifications** — subscribe once from the Dashboard (**Browser notifications** card) and every in-app notification (bookings, chat, fraud flags, KYC decisions, saved-search matches) is also **pushed to your browser even when Rentora is closed**. VAPID keys generated by `scripts/generate_vapid.py` (`pywebpush` server-side + `public/sw.js` service worker); dead subscriptions are auto-pruned (410 Gone), and no VAPID = safe no-op for local dev/CI.
- **Referral program** — every account gets a unique referral code; share your **invite link** (Dashboard → **Invite friends** card, with WhatsApp/Facebook shortcuts) and signups landing with `?ref=CODE` are attributed to you (`GET /users/referral/` shows your code, link and who joined). `ref` is optional at register — the code is just a query param on the shared URL.
- **Wishlist sharing** — one tap **Share wishlist** copies a public, unguessable link (`/wishlist/share/<token>/`) — room summaries only, no personal info, 404 on bad tokens so they can't be enumerated.
- **Landlord tools — listing insights** — new Dashboard **Insights** tab: per-listing engagement (**views 7d/30d** tracked from room-detail visits, deduplicated), wishlist saves, booking requests vs approvals, and **price vs area-average** positioning (from the market-stats table) with a red/green delta badge — plus bulk listing creation (`POST /rooms/bulk/`).
- **Reviews v2 — replies, photos, rating breakdown** — reviews now support **landlord replies** (inline form for the room owner, shown under the review), **tenant photo reviews**, and the room modal shows a **rating breakdown** (5★ histogram + average + verified-stay badges) from `GET /reviews/summary/?room=`.
- **Engineering** — 388 automated tests (210 backend + 178 frontend), ruff/eslint/prettier clean, migrations include a backfill so every existing account gets a unique referral code + wishlist token.

## 🆕 Changelog — What's New in v2.0

**Paid Listing Tiers (first revenue stream)**

- Free → **Featured** (৳199/30d) → **Premium** (৳499/30d) promotion payments via SSLCommerz/bKash
- Server-side pricing, ownership + duplicate-tier guards, double-click race protection, premium-first search ordering
- Expired promotions auto-revert to Free (`expire_listings` command + query-time `effective_tier`)
- Dashboard **Listings** tab with Promote modal; gold/orange tier badges on cards

**Roommate Matching** — weighted scoring (budget/area/room-type/gender/lifestyle) with request/approve flow

**Fraud Detection** — 6-detector engine (duplicate title, copied description, price anomaly vs market percentiles, missing images, unverified owner, rapid spam) with auto-scan + admin review queue**Auth & Trust**

- Fresh **login/register redesign** (animated Dribbble-style auth page)
- **Deep password strength meter** — zxcvbn-ts engine: real entropy (`~10^N` guesses), common-password detection ("top-10 common password" warnings), 4-segment meter, live confirm-match indicator
- **HaveIBeenPwned breach check** — k-anonymity lookup (only the first 5 chars of the SHA-1 hash leave the device); shows ⚠️ breached / ✓ safe / unknown status on the register form**Two-Factor Authentication (email OTP)**
- Password + one-time code — enabled per account from the Dashboard; **enabling is email-verified**: password first, then a code emailed to the address must be confirmed, so an account can never be locked behind an unreachable inbox
- **10 one-time recovery codes** minted at enable (shown exactly once, stored hashed) — sign in with one if you lose email access; deleted when 2FA is disabled
- OTP codes stored **hashed** (SHA-256) in the DB; 10-minute TTL, 5-attempt lockout, 30s resend cooldown, stale challenges auto-invalidated on re-login
- Login returns a pending challenge (masked destination, e.g. `r***@rentora.com`); tokens are only issued after the code verifies — no tokens leak at the password step

**Passkeys (WebAuthn / FIDO2)**

- Passwordless sign-in with a fingerprint, face, or device PIN — `py_webauthn` server-side, `@simplewebauthn/browser` client-side
- **Conditional UI** on the login form: passkeys surface in the browser's native autofill; a manual "Sign in with a passkey" button is the fallback
- Only **public keys** stored; sign counters tracked for clone/replay protection; 2FA-enabled accounts still get the email-OTP step after the passkey
- Register/revoke from the Dashboard → Security → Passkeys
- Sign in with **username or email**; **duplicate-email registration now blocked** (serializer + DB unique constraint) with a readable error message
- Already-logged-in users are redirected from `/auth` to their dashboard

**Interactive Map (Phase 7)**

- **MapLibre GL JS** map of Dhaka — OpenStreetMap tiles, key-free, with dark/light tile switching that follows the app theme
- **Price marker pins** — every listing is a tappable pin showing its price (`৳12k`), coloured by tier (free orange / featured blue / premium amber) so promoted rooms pop exactly like the list
- **Marker clustering** — with many listings in view, pins collapse into numbered cluster circles that show the **room count + average rent** (click one for a count/price-range popup, then it zooms in); toggle between **Clustered** and **Pins** modes
- **Viewport sync** — panning/zooming refetches rooms inside the visible `bbox` (debounced 300ms), so the map and the room count always match what's on screen
- **Radius search** — click a point on the map (or a university chip) and drag a slider to see rooms within 0.5–5 km, powered by the geo backend's `near_lat`/`near_lng` + `radius_km`
- **Travel-time overlay** — with a search point active, toggle **Travel** to draw walking isochrones (10/20/30 min bands, green → amber → red) so tenants see how far they can get on foot from a university, metro or office
- **Street search + autocomplete** — type a street, area or station ("gulshan", "mirpur road", "shahbagh") and pick a suggestion to fly there and start a radius search, powered by the curated Dhaka gazetteer **with an OpenStreetMap Nominatim fallback** (`/rooms/geocode/`) so even streets outside the curated list geocode
- **Get Directions + travel-mode toggle** — every room popup shows walking **and** driving ETA ("≈ 8 min walk · ≈ 2 min drive") plus a 🚶 **Walk** / 🚗 **Drive** / 🚇 **Transit** picker that opens Google Maps with the right route pre-filled (origin = your search point)
- **Metro ETA in popups** — each popup lists the nearest MRT station with distance + walking time ("🚇 Kawran Bazar MRT · 2.0 km · ≈ 27 min walk") from the backend's `proximity` annotation
- **Area count chips** — the current viewport's areas appear as tappable chips with live room counts ("Dhanmondi 3 · Mirpur 3") from `/rooms/summary/` `by_area`; tap one to fly there and start a radius search
- **Metro route corridor** — MRT Line 6 is drawn as a polyline through its stations (Uttara → Motijheel), visible with the Metro toggle or whenever the travel overlay is active; stations within a 30-minute walk of the search point get a highlighted ring
- **Room-count API badge** — the "N of M rooms in view" badge reads the authoritative server count (`/rooms/summary/` — COUNT/AVG with the same geo filters), so it is never capped by list pagination
- **Distance markers** — every listing in a radius search shows `formatDistance` + walking time ("1.2 km away · ≈ 16 min walk") in its map popup and the side list, from the backend's `distance_km` annotation
- **Viewport bbox cache** — the refetch bbox is quantized to ~100 m, so micro-pans hit the React Query cache instead of firing duplicate API calls
- **Landmark layers** — toggle universities 🎓 and metro stations 🚇 on/off as map layers (from `/rooms/landmarks/`)
- **Price heatmap** — green → amber → red circles scaled by rent, so expensive areas are visible at a glance
- **Map + list split view** — a viewport-synced sidebar lists the rooms on screen (promoted first, then by price); on mobile it becomes a bottom sheet
- Tapping a pin opens the room popup → full **RoomModal** (booking, chat, fraud badge, AI price insight)
- **Shareable map URLs** — the current viewport (center + zoom + radius search) is live-synced to the URL (`/map?center=23.81,90.41&zoom=12&r=23.78,90.40,2.0`), so you can copy the address and share an exact map view; the **Share** button copies the link, and opening a shared link restores the exact view, radius and area chips
- **Readable in both themes** — dark tiles are the CARTO CDN; if it's unreachable the map auto-falls back to dimmed OSM tiles (street labels stay legible), and the travel overlay + legend are styled for light _and_ dark

**Intelligent Map (Phase 7 v2) — Rental Decision Intelligence**

- **AI Smart Map Search** (🧠 "AI Map" button) — ask the map in Bangla, English or Banglish ("উত্তরায় ১২ হাজারের মধ্যে furnished room", "metro er kache room, Banani under 15k") and it parses the query into **hard filters** (area, budget, room type, amenities, metro proximity), flies to the matched area or metro station, updates the pins, and shows intent chips so you can see exactly what it understood — powered by the existing NL parser + gazetteer (`/rooms/map-intel/search/`), no hallucinated listings
- **Metro Commute Score** — every relevant listing carries a 0–100 transit-access score (walking time to the nearest MRT station, real curated station data) shown in the value-score chip
- **Commute mode** (🚇) — set a destination on the map (office / university / any point), and every visible listing gets a walking-time estimate ("🚶 8 min"); filter by max commute (15–60 min) — ETAs are honest straight-line estimates, labelled as such
- **Best Value Score** (⭐) — a transparent 0–100 server-side blend of price-fit vs the area market, amenities, listing quality, KYC verification, demand and metro access; each marker popup shows the score + transit factor, and the panel lists the top-value visible rooms
- **Area Intelligence panel** (🏛️ Areas) — tap an area chip for avg/median rent, listing counts, availability, 30-day demand (views/saves/bookings), metro access and price trend — all from real data, `—` where none exists; select up to 3 areas for a side-by-side **comparison table**
- **Affordability map** (💰 Budget) — drag a budget slider and see the **real % of currently listed rooms** per area that fit (green/amber/red bars) — a listing share, not an estimate
- **Ideal Area ranking** (⭐ Ideal Area) — budget + optional destination → the top areas ranked with the *why* ("100% of Mirpur listings fit your ৳10,000 budget · ~28 min commute (MRT estimate)")
- **Destination pin** — click the map to drop a teal destination flag for commute/ideal-area ranking; the pin is persisted in the shareable URL
- **Everything real** — no fabricated statistics: ETAs are labelled heuristics, transit ETA only exists along the MRT Line-6 corridor, and areas without data say "—"

See [`docs/INTELLIGENT_MAP.md`](docs/INTELLIGENT_MAP.md) (architecture) · [`docs/MAP_API.md`](docs/MAP_API.md) (endpoints) · [`docs/MAP_SCORING.md`](docs/MAP_SCORING.md) (formulas).

**Listing Location Picker (landlord)**

- **List a Room** now opens a proper form with a **map picker** — click the map to pin the exact listing location (or "Use my location")
- Coordinates are stored as `lat`/`lng`, powering the map view, geo search and price insight

**KYC Verification + Verified Landlord Badge**

- **Identity document upload** — landlords upload a NID or passport (image/PDF, 5 MB cap) from **Dashboard → KYC** (`KycCard`); uploads are stored server-side and **served through an auth-gated endpoint** (owner/admin only — the public media URL can never leak a document, and other users get a 404 so no existence leak)
- **Admin review panel** — pending applications queue (``GET /users/kyc/pending/``) with approve/reject; a decision flips `nid_verified`, **syncs every listing badge** via signals, resolves the pending documents, writes an **audit-log entry** (`kyc.approved` / `kyc.rejected`) and notifies the landlord — all inside one `transaction.atomic()` block
- **KYC audit trail** — Dashboard → KYC → History lists every decision (who, when, note) straight from the append-only audit log
- **Verified badge everywhere** — RoomCard pill, RoomModal, Roommates match cards, and **Chat** (shield next to a verified participant's name); verified-first ranking inside each tier
- **"Verified landlords only" filter** — one toggle on the Rooms page (`?verified=true`) narrows results to KYC-approved owners
- **E2E coverage** — upload → 403 for non-admin → queue → approve (badge flip + audit + notification + fraud signal clears) → reject with note → **reject → re-upload → approve full loop** (the landlord sees the reviewer's note on their rejected doc, re-submits, and the badge finally lands — the audit trail tells the whole story) → revoke flips back → privacy (404 for strangers) → file-type guard: 12 KYC tests
- **Rejection UX** — the dashboard KycCard shows a **"Why it was rejected"** banner with the reviewer's note (e.g. *"Blurry scan — please re-upload"*) plus the upload form, so the landlord knows exactly what to fix before re-submitting
- **Rejection email** — a rejection also sends a **branded transactional email** (`kyc_rejected` template) with the reviewer's note and a **direct re-upload CTA** that deep-links to the dashboard KYC tab, so the landlord can fix and resubmit without hunting through the app
- **KYC review SLA stats** — the admin panel now opens with a **queue-health strip**: pending applications (with the oldest-waiting age), average review time (all-time + this week), and a 7-day decision trend (`▲ +N / ▼ -N` vs last week), all from `GET /users/kyc/sla/` (admin-only)
- **SLA breach badges** — when a breach fires the strip grows **red alert chips** ("Application waiting >48h" / "Decisions down vs last week"), matching the flags the daily beat alert emails about — dashboard and alerts never disagree (same thresholds)
- **30-day decision trend chart** — the admin History tab now opens with a lightweight **dependency-free SVG chart**: daily decision counts (bars) + average review hours (line) over the last 30 days, bucketed server-side with `TruncDate`

**Engineering**

- **Coverage history per branch** — every PR and main push appends its own `history-<branch>.csv` + SVG chart to the `coverage-history` branch (viewable `index.html` linking all branches)
- 528 automated tests (334 backend + 194 frontend) · coverage gates (BE ≥50%, FE ≥55%)
- Ruff + ESLint + Prettier with husky/lint-staged pre-commit hooks
- GitHub Actions CI (backend, frontend, **live API contract check**, **frontend schema contract** (TS types vs OpenAPI), **schema-drift PR comment**, lint, coverage-summary PR comment, per-branch coverage history)
- Route-level code splitting (React.lazy) — smaller bundles

**Search & Discovery (Phase 11) — ✨ AI Smart Search**

- **AI Search toggle** — the Rooms page's search bar grows a gradient **✨ AI Search** button; flip it on and the box accepts *natural language*: "১০ হাজার এর মধ্যে uttara student room" is understood as **budget ≤ ৳10,000 in Uttara** (and "জুলাই move-in" as a July move-in date)
- **Bangla + English natural-language parser** (`rooms/nl_query.py`) — Bangla digits (০-৯), **number words** (দশ/বিশ/ত্রিশ… with হাজার/লাখ/কোটি multipliers — "দশ হাজার" → ৳10,000), ৳/টাকা/tk/taka, **area names in both scripts** (Uttara *and* উত্তরা, Dhanmondi *and* ধানমন্ডি — from the gazetteer's new Bangla aliases), room-type/gender words and month names in both scripts; the parsed budget/area/type/gender become **real filters**, and the list response carries an `nl_parsed` object
- **"AI understood" chips** — under the search bar the backend's interpretation renders as tappable-looking pills (`Budget ≤ ৳10,000` · `Uttara` · `move-in July`) so tenants see exactly what was understood
- **Hybrid neural semantic ranking** — smart search now blends **two relevance legs** with configurable weights (`SEMANTIC_SEARCH_WEIGHT=0.7` neural + `TFIDF_SEARCH_WEIGHT=0.3` lexical). The neural leg uses **pluggable embeddings** (`rooms/embedding_service.py`): a zero-dependency bilingual synonym-hash provider runs out of the box (no heavy deps — "affordable student room" finds "কম বাজেটের শিক্ষার্থীদের থাকার রুম" in both query directions), and installing the optional `sentence-transformers` package transparently upgrades it to real multilingual neural embeddings. If embeddings are unavailable, ranking degrades to the TF-IDF/LSA leg, then to keyword search — search never breaks
- **Typo tolerance** — smart search resolves same-script typos against a bounded area gazetteer: `mirpore`/`মিরপূর` still find Mirpur, `Dhanmondhi` finds Dhanmondi, `uttra` finds Uttara (`FUZZY_SEARCH_ENABLED`)
- **Bangla/English area aliases** — a single alias table (`rooms/area_aliases.py`) resolves every spelling of a place — `ধানমন্ডি`, `ধানমণ্ডি`, `Dhanmondi`, `Dhanmondhi`, `ধানমন্ডি ২৭`, `mirpur 10`, `উত্তরা সেক্টর ১০` — to its canonical area, shared by the NL parser and map gazetteer (`AREA_ALIAS_ENABLED`)
- **Personalized search re-ranking** — for signed-in tenants, smart-search results are re-ranked within the relevant pool by the user's preference profile (preferred area/type/budget/amenities — reused from the recommendation engine, no duplicated logic); cold-start users get plain relevance ranking and **hard filters (budget/area) always win** (`PERSONALIZED_SEARCH_ENABLED`, `PERSONALIZATION_WEIGHT=0.15`)
- **Price-anomaly badge** — room cards show a transparent price-vs-market chip (`↑ 25% above market`) computed from the existing fair-price prediction model, trained once per request and only rendered when the prediction is confident and the gap clears `PRICE_ANOMALY_THRESHOLD` (20%)
- **Debug ranking metadata** — `?debug_rank=1` (or `DEBUG=true`) attaches `rank_meta` (semantic/lexical/personalization/final scores per room) to the list response; never exposed to normal users
- **Personal ranking boost** — for signed-in tenants the default browse order floats rooms they recently viewed or wishlisted to the top (30-day window), layered under the paid-tier/verified ranking
- **Look-Alike Rooms (visual search)** — every RoomModal now shows a "Look-Alike Rooms" strip: rooms whose primary photo looks like the current one, via 64-bit **perceptual hashes (pHash)** computed with Pillow and cached in a new `RoomImageHash` table (mtime-keyed, so replaced photos re-hash automatically); `GET /rooms/{id}/similar-images/`
- **Dhaka coverage expanded** — the listing `Area` choices now span **20 areas** (Uttara, Tejgaon, Badda, Rampura, Banasree, Khilgaon, Motijheel, Old Dhaka, Bashundhara, Lalmatia, Shyamoli, Savar, Keraniganj, Tongi + the original 6) and the map gazetteer gained **40+ new streets/roads** (Panthapath, Bailey Road, Hatirjheel, Badda Link Road, Khilgaon Flyover, Uttara Sectors 10/12/14, Gulshan 1/2 circles, Jashimuddin Avenue …) plus 9 more universities (Jagannath, Dhaka Medical College, AUST, DIU, Stamford, UIU …) — all searchable from the map box and the NL parser
- **Bug fixes along the way** — the room list now sends the backend's `q` search param correctly (`params.search` → `params.q`), and the API client no longer yanks **anonymous** visitors to `/auth` when a public endpoint 401s (the bounce is now reserved for sessions that actually went stale) — regression-tested

**Core AI & Fraud Intelligence (Phase 11++) — Rentora Copilot, AI pricing v2, duplicate-image fraud**

- **🤖 Rentora Copilot** (`COPILOT_ENABLED`) — a floating conversational assistant (bottom-right, every page): ask in Bangla, English or Banglish ("Uttara-তে ১০ হাজারের মধ্যে furnished student room চাই") and it searches the **live** listings. Hybrid and free: intent parsing (reusing the NL parser + an amenity/property word table) feeds the existing search/ranking pipeline, and the reply is generated over the *retrieved* rows only — **it can never hallucinate a room, price or amenity**, and no LLM is required. Follow-up turns keep context ("শুধু furnished দেখাও" retains Uttara + budget via a session_id), listing cards open the full RoomModal, quick-reply chips are backend-generated (`POST /api/v1/copilot/chat/`, 60/hr throttle). See `docs/RENTORA_COPILOT.md`
- **🏷️ AI pricing suggestion v2** (`GET /pricing/suggestion/:id/`, owner/admin) — the fair-price model upgraded with **demand**: recommended price + range (rounded to ৳500), a 0–100 demand score from real engagement (views vs area peers, wishlist saves, booking requests, area heat), **estimated time-to-rent** from actual booking history (never fabricated — "Insufficient historical data" when there aren't 5 samples), composite confidence, and explainable reasons ("Similar Mirpur singles average ৳8,500"). Cached per room + market snapshot. Dashboard → **Insights** → **AI Price** expands the suggestion card with a **Use ৳12,500** button — the landlord always decides; nothing changes automatically. See `docs/AI_PRICING_V2.md`
- **🖼️ Cross-listing duplicate-image fraud detection** (`DUPLICATE_IMAGE_FRAUD_ENABLED`) — the pHash pipeline (already powering look-alike rooms) now feeds a 7th fraud detector: the same photo re-used across listings is flagged with contextual severity (same-owner agency posts → low; different owners → medium; different owner **and** area, or 3+ matches → high). Hex-prefix pre-filtering keeps scans from N×N; same-listing galleries and blank images are never flagged; the signal feeds the existing fraud score → search ranking, and the admin **Fraud Operations** panel shows matched-listing chips + similarity %. See `docs/DUPLICATE_IMAGE_FRAUD.md`

**Listing Intelligence (Phase 11+) — voice search, AI saved-search matching, listing quality, fraud-aware ranking**

- **🎤 Bangla voice search** — the search bar grows a microphone button (`VOICE_SEARCH_ENABLED`): the browser's **Web Speech API** transcribes Bangla / Banglish / English naturally ("উত্তরা ১০ হাজারের মধ্যে রুম" → `?q=`), and the transcript flows straight into the existing NL parser + semantic ranking — no new NLP pipeline, **no audio ever stored or uploaded** (only the transcript). Unsupported browsers hide the button; permission-denied shows a friendly hint; text search always works (`useVoiceSearch` hook, states: idle/listening/processing/denied/unsupported/error)
- **🧠 AI saved-search matcher** (`SAVED_SEARCH_AI_MATCHING_ENABLED`) — saved-search alerts upgraded from "new listing" to **"Highly relevant room found in Uttara"** with *why it matched* reasons (✓ matches your area ✓ within budget ✓ similar to rooms you viewed). Two-stage pipeline: **hard filters always gate first** (area/budget/type/gender — a Dhanmondi room can never match a Uttara search), then a weighted relevance score (`area/price/room-type/semantic/preference/quality`, weights + `SAVED_SEARCH_MATCH_THRESHOLD=0.75` configurable). Alerts fire in-app from a **room create/price-change event task** and the daily digest, deduplicated by a **cooldown** (`SAVED_SEARCH_COOLDOWN_HOURS`); **price-drop alerts** (≥ `PRICE_DROP_NOTIFICATION_THRESHOLD` 10%) ride on the new `RoomPriceHistory` table written by a post-save signal
- **✨ Listing quality score** (`LISTING_QUALITY_SCORE_ENABLED`) — every listing gets a transparent **0–100 completeness score** (basic info 20 / description 20 / photos 20 / location 15 / amenities 15 / pricing 10 — weights configurable) with **actionable suggestions** ("Add 3 more photos", "Description is too short…", "Add nearby landmark information"). Shown as a quality chip on the room detail page and a **per-listing Quality column in the landlord Insights dashboard** with a tap-for-suggestions popover, plus an **Avg Listing Quality card** on the landlord overview. It's *not* a valuation and *not* a fraud score — every point is explainable
- **🛡️ Fraud-aware search ranking** (`FRAUD_AWARE_RANKING_ENABLED`) — smart-search results are **demoted by the existing fraud engine's risk score** (one query, no re-scan): high-risk listings sink below clean ones of equal relevance (`FRAUD_RANKING_PENALTY_WEIGHT=0.20`), and critical-risk handling follows the existing moderation flow — ranking **never hides or deletes** a listing. Risk never overrides explicit user intent (hard filters → relevance → personalization → quality → fraud), and internal detector evidence is never exposed to normal users (admin dashboard unchanged)
- **Search pipeline now**: query → normalization → area-alias expansion → hard filters → lexical + semantic legs → personalization → quality + fraud secondary signals → final ranking → API response
- **Copilot retrieval reuses the same pipeline** — hard filters (budget/area/type/gender/amenities) gate first, then hybrid ranking — so a Copilot answer and the Rooms page agree by construction

## 🧪 Quality Engineering

Quality is enforced **in CI and at commit time** — style or coverage drift fails the pipeline automatically.

### Automated tests (414 total)

| Suite             | Count | Gate                                               |
| ----------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend (Django)  | 229   | ✅ passing · coverage ≥ 50% lines (currently ~61%) |
| Frontend (Vitest) | 185   | ✅ passing · coverage ≥ 55% lines (currently ~99%) |

```bash
# Backend
cd backend && venv/Scripts/python.exe -m coverage run manage.py test && venv/Scripts/python.exe -m coverage report

# Frontend
cd frontend && npx vitest run --coverage
```

### Lint & format

```bash
# Backend (ruff)
cd backend
venv/Scripts/python.exe -m ruff check .          # lint
venv/Scripts/python.exe -m ruff check --fix .    # auto-fix

### Pre-commit hooks (husky + lint-staged)

Installed automatically by `npm install` (`prepare` script). On every commit it runs **only on staged files**:

| Staged file                        | Runs                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `backend/**/*.py`                  | `ruff check --fix` + `ruff format` |
| `frontend/**/*.{ts,tsx}`           | `prettier --write` + `eslint`      |
| `frontend/**/*.{css,json,md,html}` | `prettier --write`                 |

If a check fails, the commit is **blocked** — fix and commit again (bypass with `git commit --no-verify` only when intentional).

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

| Workflow               | Job                                                         | Runs on         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `ci.yml`               | Backend — Django tests + coverage gate                      | every push / PR |
| `ci.yml`               | Frontend — Vitest + coverage + `npm run build`              | every push / PR |
| `ci.yml`               | API contract — boots a server + runs the live endpoint suite vs the docs reference (**status codes + deep JSON schema + request-body contracts + OpenAPI path cross-check**; response/request contracts are **auto-generated from the live OpenAPI schema** at runtime — `docs/tools/api-verify.py`) | every push / PR |
| `ci.yml`               | **Frontend contract** — regenerates TS types from the live OpenAPI schema (`openapi-typescript`) and typechecks the hand-written wire types (`services/mappers.ts`) against them via `src/lib/schemaContract.ts` — a backend field rename/removal/type change fails the PR | every push / PR |
| `ci.yml`               | **Schema drift** — diffs the PR head's OpenAPI schema against the base branch and posts a sticky PR comment listing every endpoint/field contract change (`docs/tools/schema-drift.py`; doc-only changes ignored) | PRs |
| `security.yml`         | **Security** — `pip-audit` (dependency advisories, hard-fail), Bandit (MEDIUM+ static analysis, hard-fail), Django `check --deploy`, security regression tests (upload validation / admin-only fraud / IDOR / KYC ownership), `npm audit --audit-level=high` (hard-fail) and a **gitleaks** secret scan — all with least-privilege `contents: read` | every push / PR |
| `ci.yml`               | Lint — ruff + ESLint + Prettier                             | every push / PR |
| `coverage-summary.yml` | Posts a coverage **PR comment** (badge + file-level detail) | PRs             |
| `ci.yml` `coverage-history` job | Appends per-branch coverage history (`history-<branch>.csv` + SVG chart) to the `coverage-history` branch | pushes to main **and** PRs (same-repo; fork PRs skip) |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start (TL;DR)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SadmaFaahiim/Rentora.git && cd Rentora

# Backend → http://localhost:8000
cd backend
python -m venv venv && venv\Scripts\activate   # (Linux/macOS: source venv/bin/activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py seed_rooms                  # 20+ rooms + demo landlords (password: demo12345)
python manage.py runserver

# Frontend → http://localhost:3000 (new terminal)
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

> 💡 `seed_rooms` also creates the demo users below — sign in with any username + `demo12345`.
> No `.env` files are required; sensible defaults work out of the box.
>
> **Optional — real neural embeddings:** smart search works out of the box with the built-in
> zero-dependency lite provider. To upgrade to true multilingual transformer embeddings,
> install the optional package: `pip install sentence-transformers` (a multi-hundred-MB
> download incl. PyTorch) — the app detects it automatically and uses
> `SEMANTIC_EMBEDDING_MODEL` (default: `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`).

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Git

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Seed sample data (rooms + demo landlords)
python manage.py seed_rooms

# Scan all rooms with the fraud engine (optional)
python manage.py scan_rooms

# Create admin user
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Start server
python manage.py runserver

# Backup the database (SQLite copy or pg_dump; prunes old backups)
python ../scripts/backup_db.py --keep 14
```

Backend runs at `http://localhost:8000`

**Celery (optional, async mode)** — with no broker configured, tasks run eagerly
(synchronously) so nothing extra is needed locally. To run a real worker + beat
schedule, start Redis and set `CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0` in
`backend/.env`, then:

```bash
celery -A config worker -l info
celery -A config beat -l info
```

**Error tracking** — set `SENTRY_DSN` (backend `.env`) and `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`
(frontend `.env`) to enable Sentry; leaving them unset keeps everything working
with no events sent. See `docs/ops/backup-restore.md` for the backup/restore
runbook.

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file
echo "VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1" > .env

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at `http://localhost:3000`

**Text filters:** `?area=Dhanmondi&room_type=studio&price__gte=5000&price__lte=15000&is_available=true&q=cozy&ordering=-price&owner=3`

**Smart search:** `?q=১০ হাজার এর মধ্যে uttara student room&smart=1` — natural-language parsing (budget/area/type/gender become filters), **hybrid ranking** over the filtered pool (neural embeddings + TF-IDF/LSA, with typo-tolerant area aliases and per-user personalization for signed-in tenants), and an `nl_parsed` block describing what was understood. List cards also carry an optional `price_anomaly` object (`{predicted_price, difference_percentage, direction, badge}`) when the listing's price is confidentially ≥20% above/below the predicted market price.

**Geo filters:**

- `bbox=min_lng,min_lat,max_lng,max_lat` — map viewport (leaflet `getBounds()`)
- `near_lat=23.75&near_lng=90.39&radius_km=2` — radius around a point (nearest-first)
- `near_landmark=mirpur-10-metro&radius_km=3` — radius around a named landmark/metro station

## 🔐 Security

- JWT authentication with access/refresh token rotation
- **Unique email enforced at the API and database layers** (registration, admin, seed scripts all covered)
- Rate limiting (auth: 10/hr per IP, anon: 100/hr, user: 1000/hr, payment initiation: 5/hr)
- Input sanitization via bleach on all user-generated text
- CORS configured (dev: all origins, prod: pinned domains)
- Custom error handler with consistent JSON envelope
- Production security headers (HSTS, XSS filter, content-type nosniff)
- **Append-only audit log** for sensitive actions (fraud-report reviews, 2FA changes) — immutable in the admin, so an audit trail cannot be rewritten
- **Error tracking** via Sentry (backend + frontend) and **structured JSON logs** (`JSON_LOGS=True`) so incidents are visible and searchable
- **Defensive fraud scanning** — a detector or queue failure can never break room creation; detector errors are isolated and logged
- **Fraud engine** auto-scans every new listing — flagged listings go into an admin review queue
- **Password hygiene on register** — zxcvbn-ts entropy scoring rejects trivially guessable passwords with actionable warnings; HaveIBeenPwned k-anonymity check warns when the chosen password appears in known data breaches (nothing but a 5-char hash prefix ever leaves the device)
- **Two-factor authentication (email OTP)** — challenge codes are stored hashed, TTL-bounded (10 min), attempt-limited (5 → lock) and cooldown-guarded; the login endpoint never returns tokens for a 2FA account until the code is verified
- **2FA enable is email-verified** — password + emailed code are both required before `otp_enabled` flips, and **recovery codes** (10, hashed, single-use) are minted at that moment; disabling deletes them
- **Passkeys** — public-key only storage, sign-counter replay protection, conditional UI on login
- **KYC document privacy** — identity documents are served through an **auth-gated endpoint** (owner/admin only); the public media URL can never expose a document, and non-owners get a 404 so even file existence is hidden
- **Automated security CI** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`) — `pip-audit` dependency advisories (hard-fail), Bandit MEDIUM+ static analysis (hard-fail), Django `check --deploy`, security regression tests (upload validation / admin-only fraud / IDOR / KYC ownership), `npm audit --audit-level=high` (hard-fail) and a **gitleaks** secret scan — running on every push/PR with least-privilege permissions

## 🔑 Passkeys / WebAuthn — Shipped

Passwordless sign-in is live — the phishing-resistant successor to passwords + OTP:

| Aspect              | TOTP/OTP (email)                                | Passkeys (WebAuthn)                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| UX friction         | Open email, copy 6-digit code                   | One tap / biometric (Touch ID, Windows Hello)   |
| Phishing resistance | Vulnerable (codes can be typed into fake sites) | **Immune** — bound to the exact origin (`rpId`) |
| Secrets             | Shared secret stored server-side                | Server stores **public keys only**              |

**Implemented with** `py_webauthn` (webauthn 3.x, Duo Labs) server-side + `@simplewebauthn/browser` client-side. Four DRF endpoints: `passkey/register/begin` → `passkey/register/complete` (JWT-authed), `passkey/login/begin` → `passkey/login/complete` (issues JWTs). Conditional UI (`mediation: 'conditional'`) surfaces passkeys in the browser's native autofill; a manual **"Sign in with a passkey"** button is the fallback. Register/revoke from Dashboard → Security → Passkeys.

**Gotchas handled:** WebAuthn requires a secure origin (`localhost` is fine; IP addresses are not); frontend/backend should share a registrable domain in production (e.g. `app.example.com` + `api.example.com` with `rpId: example.com`); an `AbortController` cancels a pending conditional ceremony when the user submits the password form.

| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🏠 Landlord | `rahim.hossain` | Roommate matches (Sabbir 87%, Nadia 76%), room listing, **Paid Tiers** (Dashboard → Listings → Promote) |
| 🏠 Landlord | `nadia.islam`   | Shared Premium Gulshan listing                                                                          |

| 🏠 Landlord | `kyc.demo`      | **Unverified landlord** — Dashboard → KYC: upload a document, then watch an admin approve it and the **verified badge** appear on your listing + chat                                      |
| 🏠 Landlord | `kyc.rejected`  | **Rejected KYC demo** — Dashboard → KYC shows the **"Why it was rejected"** banner with the reviewer's note and a ready re-upload form                                  |

**Tips**

- All seeded accounts are **landlords** — to explore the **tenant** side (browse, search, wishlist, book, chat), just **register a fresh account** from the login page (unique email required) or use the platform anonymously for browsing.
- **Admin:** run `python manage.py createsuperuser` then open `http://localhost:8000/admin/` — the fraud review queue, KYC review, and the append-only audit trail live there.
- Sign in with the **username** (e.g. `rahim.hossain`) **or** the email address (e.g. `rahim.hossain@rentora.com`) — both work.
- `rahim.hossain` has a roommate profile — log in and open **Roommates** to see live match scores.
- `tanvir.islam` has listings — open **Dashboard → Fraud** to see the risk cards and try **Re-scan**.
- `kyc.rejected` starts with a rejected document — open **Dashboard → KYC** to see the rejection note, then upload a clear copy to restart the review loop.
- **Try 2FA:** Dashboard → **Two-Factor Authentication** → **Enable 2FA** (current password → emailed code → save your **recovery codes**). Next sign-in asks for the emailed code (or a recovery code). In development the code prints to the backend console; in production it goes to the account's email.
- **Try passkeys:** Dashboard → Security → **Passkeys** → **Register a passkey** (your device's biometric/PIN), then sign out and use the login page's passkey autofill or the **"Sign in with a passkey"** button.

## 🔄 Team Workflow

- **Branching:** feature work happens on `feature/<name>` branches off `main`; never commit directly to `main`.
- **Pull requests:** every branch ships as a PR against `main`; CI must be green (tests, coverage, lint, build) before merge.
- **Pre-commit:** husky + lint-staged format and lint staged files on every commit.
- **Environments:** local dev (SQLite + runserver) → CI (GitHub Actions) → production (PostgreSQL + Daphne, Phase 8).
