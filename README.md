| **Problem**         | Finding a trustworthy room in Dhaka is hard — listings are scattered, landlords are hard to verify, and scams are common.                                                                     |
| **Solution**        | One verified marketplace: AI-scanned listings, real-time landlord chat, secure gateway payments, roommate matching, and an ML-powered fraud engine that catches bad actors before tenants do. |
| **Target users**    | Tenants (students & young professionals) and landlords in Bangladesh.                                                                                                                         |
| **Differentiators** | Fraud-engineered trust layer, AI recommendations & fair-price insight, roommates (a growth hook competitors lack), and a monetized listing-tier system (Free → Featured → Premium).           |

## 🆕 Changelog

**Phase 9 — Operate It (Reliability & Observability)**

- **Sentry error tracking** — backend (Django/Celery integrations) and frontend (`@sentry/react`); initialised from `SENTRY_DSN` / `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` and a **no-op when unset**, so local dev and CI never send events. Frontend error boundary forwards component stacks.
- **Structured JSON logging** — a stdlib-only `JSONFormatter` (`config/logging.py`) emits one JSON object per line when `JSON_LOGS=True`; stable keys (timestamp/level/logger/message) plus caller extras, ready for any log shipper.
- **Celery + Celery Beat** — `config/celery.py` with a **zero-config local mode**: an empty `CELERY_BROKER_URL` runs tasks eagerly (synchronously, no Redis), production sets a Redis broker and tasks go async. Scheduled maintenance moved onto the beat schedule: hourly tier expiry, daily market-stat refresh, daily catalogue fraud re-scan, daily rent reminders (`rooms/pricing/fraud/payments/tasks.py`).
- **Fraud hardening** — the auto-scan now runs through a Celery task wrapped in try/except so a detector or queue failure can **never break room creation**; individual detector failures are isolated (logged + skipped, the rest still run); the flag path now also emails the landlord.
- **Branded HTML transactional emails** — `notifications/emails.py` + `notifications/templates/emails/` (base shell + OTP code, recovery codes, booking status, fraud flag, promotion expiry), each with a plain-text fallback. Wired into OTP delivery, 2FA-enable recovery codes, booking lifecycle signals, fraud flags, and `expire_listings`.
- **Audit log** — new `audit` app: an append-only `AuditLogEntry` table records who did what to which object (with IP) for sensitive actions. Wired into fraud-report review and 2FA enable/disable; the Django admin view is read-only so the trail cannot be rewritten.
- **Backup & restore runbook** — `scripts/backup_db.py` (cross-platform; SQLite consistent copy via the backup API, PostgreSQL via `pg_dump`, pruning with `--keep`) plus `docs/ops/backup-restore.md` covering restore, media, and a quarterly restore drill.

## 🆕 Changelog — What's New in v2.0

**Paid Listing Tiers (first revenue stream)**

- Free → **Featured** (৳199/30d) → **Premium** (৳499/30d) promotion payments via SSLCommerz/bKash
- Server-side pricing, ownership + duplicate-tier guards, double-click race protection, premium-first search ordering
- Expired promotions auto-revert to Free (`expire_listings` command + query-time `effective_tier`)
- Dashboard **Listings** tab with Promote modal; gold/orange tier badges on cards

**Roommate Matching** — weighted scoring (budget/area/room-type/gender/lifestyle) with request/approve flow

**Fraud Detection** — 6-detector engine (duplicate title, copied description, price anomaly vs market percentiles, missing images, unverified owner, rapid spam) with auto-scan + admin review queue**Auth & Trust**

- Fresh **login/register redesign** (animated Dribbble-style auth page)
- **Deep password strength meter** — zxcvbn-ts engine: real entropy (`~10^N` guesses), common-password detection ("top-10 common password" warnings), 4-segment meter, live confirm-match indicator
- **HaveIBeenPwned breach check** — k-anonymity lookup (only the first 5 chars of the SHA-1 hash leave the device); shows ⚠️ breached / ✓ safe / unknown status on the register form**Two-Factor Authentication (email OTP)**
- Password + one-time code — enabled per account from the Dashboard; **enabling is email-verified**: password first, then a code emailed to the address must be confirmed, so an account can never be locked behind an unreachable inbox
- **10 one-time recovery codes** minted at enable (shown exactly once, stored hashed) — sign in with one if you lose email access; deleted when 2FA is disabled
- OTP codes stored **hashed** (SHA-256) in the DB; 10-minute TTL, 5-attempt lockout, 30s resend cooldown, stale challenges auto-invalidated on re-login
- Login returns a pending challenge (masked destination, e.g. `r***@rentora.com`); tokens are only issued after the code verifies — no tokens leak at the password step

**Passkeys (WebAuthn / FIDO2)**

- Passwordless sign-in with a fingerprint, face, or device PIN — `py_webauthn` server-side, `@simplewebauthn/browser` client-side
- **Conditional UI** on the login form: passkeys surface in the browser's native autofill; a manual "Sign in with a passkey" button is the fallback
- Only **public keys** stored; sign counters tracked for clone/replay protection; 2FA-enabled accounts still get the email-OTP step after the passkey
- Register/revoke from the Dashboard → Security → Passkeys
- Sign in with **username or email**; **duplicate-email registration now blocked** (serializer + DB unique constraint) with a readable error message
- Already-logged-in users are redirected from `/auth` to their dashboard

**Interactive Map (Phase 7)**

- **MapLibre GL JS** map of Dhaka — OpenStreetMap tiles, key-free, with dark/light tile switching that follows the app theme
- **Price marker pins** — every listing is a tappable pin showing its price (`৳12k`), coloured by tier (free orange / featured blue / premium amber) so promoted rooms pop exactly like the list
- **Marker clustering** — with many listings in view, pins collapse into numbered cluster circles that show the **room count + average rent** (click one for a count/price-range popup, then it zooms in); toggle between **Clustered** and **Pins** modes
- **Viewport sync** — panning/zooming refetches rooms inside the visible `bbox` (debounced 300ms), so the map and the room count always match what's on screen
- **Radius search** — click a point on the map (or a university chip) and drag a slider to see rooms within 0.5–5 km, powered by the geo backend's `near_lat`/`near_lng` + `radius_km`
- **Travel-time overlay** — with a search point active, toggle **Travel** to draw walking isochrones (10/20/30 min bands, green → amber → red) so tenants see how far they can get on foot from a university, metro or office
- **Street search + autocomplete** — type a street, area or station ("gulshan", "mirpur road", "shahbagh") and pick a suggestion to fly there and start a radius search, powered by the curated Dhaka gazetteer **with an OpenStreetMap Nominatim fallback** (`/rooms/geocode/`) so even streets outside the curated list geocode
- **Get Directions + travel-mode toggle** — every room popup shows walking **and** driving ETA ("≈ 8 min walk · ≈ 2 min drive") plus a 🚶 **Walk** / 🚗 **Drive** / 🚇 **Transit** picker that opens Google Maps with the right route pre-filled (origin = your search point)
- **Metro ETA in popups** — each popup lists the nearest MRT station with distance + walking time ("🚇 Kawran Bazar MRT · 2.0 km · ≈ 27 min walk") from the backend's `proximity` annotation
- **Area count chips** — the current viewport's areas appear as tappable chips with live room counts ("Dhanmondi 3 · Mirpur 3") from `/rooms/summary/` `by_area`; tap one to fly there and start a radius search
- **Metro route corridor** — MRT Line 6 is drawn as a polyline through its stations (Uttara → Motijheel), visible with the Metro toggle or whenever the travel overlay is active; stations within a 30-minute walk of the search point get a highlighted ring
- **Room-count API badge** — the "N of M rooms in view" badge reads the authoritative server count (`/rooms/summary/` — COUNT/AVG with the same geo filters), so it is never capped by list pagination
- **Distance markers** — every listing in a radius search shows `formatDistance` + walking time ("1.2 km away · ≈ 16 min walk") in its map popup and the side list, from the backend's `distance_km` annotation
- **Viewport bbox cache** — the refetch bbox is quantized to ~100 m, so micro-pans hit the React Query cache instead of firing duplicate API calls
- **Landmark layers** — toggle universities 🎓 and metro stations 🚇 on/off as map layers (from `/rooms/landmarks/`)
- **Price heatmap** — green → amber → red circles scaled by rent, so expensive areas are visible at a glance
- **Map + list split view** — a viewport-synced sidebar lists the rooms on screen (promoted first, then by price); on mobile it becomes a bottom sheet
- Tapping a pin opens the room popup → full **RoomModal** (booking, chat, fraud badge, AI price insight)
- **Shareable map URLs** — the current viewport (center + zoom + radius search) is live-synced to the URL (`/map?center=23.81,90.41&zoom=12&r=23.78,90.40,2.0`), so you can copy the address and share an exact map view; the **Share** button copies the link, and opening a shared link restores the exact view, radius and area chips
- **Readable in both themes** — dark tiles are the CARTO CDN; if it's unreachable the map auto-falls back to dimmed OSM tiles (street labels stay legible), and the travel overlay + legend are styled for light _and_ dark

**Listing Location Picker (landlord)**

- **List a Room** now opens a proper form with a **map picker** — click the map to pin the exact listing location (or "Use my location")
- Coordinates are stored as `lat`/`lng`, powering the map view, geo search and price insight

**KYC Verification + Verified Landlord Badge**

- **Identity document upload** — landlords upload a NID or passport (image/PDF, 5 MB cap) from **Dashboard → KYC** (`KycCard`); uploads are stored server-side and **served through an auth-gated endpoint** (owner/admin only — the public media URL can never leak a document, and other users get a 404 so no existence leak)
- **Admin review panel** — pending applications queue (``GET /users/kyc/pending/``) with approve/reject; a decision flips `nid_verified`, **syncs every listing badge** via signals, resolves the pending documents, writes an **audit-log entry** (`kyc.approved` / `kyc.rejected`) and notifies the landlord — all inside one `transaction.atomic()` block
- **KYC audit trail** — Dashboard → KYC → History lists every decision (who, when, note) straight from the append-only audit log
- **Verified badge everywhere** — RoomCard pill, RoomModal, Roommates match cards, and **Chat** (shield next to a verified participant's name); verified-first ranking inside each tier
- **"Verified landlords only" filter** — one toggle on the Rooms page (`?verified=true`) narrows results to KYC-approved owners
- **E2E coverage** — upload → 403 for non-admin → queue → approve (badge flip + audit + notification + fraud signal clears) → reject with note → revoke flips back → privacy (404 for strangers) → file-type guard: 11 KYC tests

**Engineering**

- **Coverage history per branch** — every PR and main push appends its own `history-<branch>.csv` + SVG chart to the `coverage-history` branch (viewable `index.html` linking all branches)
- 329 automated tests (165 backend + 164 frontend) · coverage gates (BE ≥50%, FE ≥55%)
- Ruff + ESLint + Prettier with husky/lint-staged pre-commit hooks
- GitHub Actions CI (backend, frontend, lint, coverage-summary PR comment, per-branch coverage history)
- Route-level code splitting (React.lazy) — smaller bundles

## 🧪 Quality Engineering

Quality is enforced **in CI and at commit time** — style or coverage drift fails the pipeline automatically.

### Automated tests (329 total)

| Suite             | Count | Gate                                               |
| ----------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend (Django)  | 165   | ✅ passing · coverage ≥ 50% lines (currently ~61%) |
| Frontend (Vitest) | 164   | ✅ passing · coverage ≥ 55% lines (currently ~99%) |

```bash
# Backend
cd backend && venv/Scripts/python.exe -m coverage run manage.py test && venv/Scripts/python.exe -m coverage report

# Frontend
cd frontend && npx vitest run --coverage
```

### Lint & format

```bash
# Backend (ruff)
cd backend
venv/Scripts/python.exe -m ruff check .          # lint
venv/Scripts/python.exe -m ruff check --fix .    # auto-fix
venv/Scripts/python.exe -m ruff format .         # format
venv/Scripts/python.exe -m ruff format --check . # verify

# Frontend (ESLint + Prettier)
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run format
npm run format:check
```

### Pre-commit hooks (husky + lint-staged)

Installed automatically by `npm install` (`prepare` script). On every commit it runs **only on staged files**:

| Staged file                        | Runs                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `backend/**/*.py`                  | `ruff check --fix` + `ruff format` |
| `frontend/**/*.{ts,tsx}`           | `prettier --write` + `eslint`      |
| `frontend/**/*.{css,json,md,html}` | `prettier --write`                 |

If a check fails, the commit is **blocked** — fix and commit again (bypass with `git commit --no-verify` only when intentional).

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

| Workflow               | Job                                                         | Runs on         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `ci.yml`               | Backend — Django tests + coverage gate                      | every push / PR |
| `ci.yml`               | Frontend — Vitest + coverage + `npm run build`              | every push / PR |
| `ci.yml`               | Lint — ruff + ESLint + Prettier                             | every push / PR |
| `coverage-summary.yml` | Posts a coverage **PR comment** (badge + file-level detail) | PRs             |     | `ci.yml` `coverage-history` job | Appends per-branch coverage history (`history-<branch>.csv` + SVG chart) to the `coverage-history` branch | pushes to main **and** PRs (same-repo; fork PRs skip) |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Git

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Seed sample data (rooms + demo landlords)
python manage.py seed_rooms

# Scan all rooms with the fraud engine (optional)
python manage.py scan_rooms

# Create admin user
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Start server
python manage.py runserver

# Backup the database (SQLite copy or pg_dump; prunes old backups)
python ../scripts/backup_db.py --keep 14
```

Backend runs at `http://localhost:8000`

**Celery (optional, async mode)** — with no broker configured, tasks run eagerly
(synchronously) so nothing extra is needed locally. To run a real worker + beat
schedule, start Redis and set `CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0` in
`backend/.env`, then:

```bash
celery -A config worker -l info
celery -A config beat -l info
```

**Error tracking** — set `SENTRY_DSN` (backend `.env`) and `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`
(frontend `.env`) to enable Sentry; leaving them unset keeps everything working
with no events sent. See `docs/ops/backup-restore.md` for the backup/restore
runbook.

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file
echo "VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1" > .env

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔐 Security

- JWT authentication with access/refresh token rotation
- **Unique email enforced at the API and database layers** (registration, admin, seed scripts all covered)
- Rate limiting (auth: 10/hr per IP, anon: 100/hr, user: 1000/hr, payment initiation: 5/hr)
- Input sanitization via bleach on all user-generated text
- CORS configured (dev: all origins, prod: pinned domains)
- Custom error handler with consistent JSON envelope
- Production security headers (HSTS, XSS filter, content-type nosniff)
- **Append-only audit log** for sensitive actions (fraud-report reviews, 2FA changes) — immutable in the admin, so an audit trail cannot be rewritten
- **Error tracking** via Sentry (backend + frontend) and **structured JSON logs** (`JSON_LOGS=True`) so incidents are visible and searchable
- **Defensive fraud scanning** — a detector or queue failure can never break room creation; detector errors are isolated and logged
- **Fraud engine** auto-scans every new listing — flagged listings go into an admin review queue
- **Password hygiene on register** — zxcvbn-ts entropy scoring rejects trivially guessable passwords with actionable warnings; HaveIBeenPwned k-anonymity check warns when the chosen password appears in known data breaches (nothing but a 5-char hash prefix ever leaves the device)
- **Two-factor authentication (email OTP)** — challenge codes are stored hashed, TTL-bounded (10 min), attempt-limited (5 → lock) and cooldown-guarded; the login endpoint never returns tokens for a 2FA account until the code is verified
- **2FA enable is email-verified** — password + emailed code are both required before `otp_enabled` flips, and **recovery codes** (10, hashed, single-use) are minted at that moment; disabling deletes them
- **Passkeys** — public-key only storage, sign-counter replay protection, conditional UI on login
- **KYC document privacy** — identity documents are served through an **auth-gated endpoint** (owner/admin only); the public media URL can never expose a document, and non-owners get a 404 so even file existence is hidden

## 🔑 Passkeys / WebAuthn — Shipped

Passwordless sign-in is live — the phishing-resistant successor to passwords + OTP:

| Aspect              | TOTP/OTP (email)                                | Passkeys (WebAuthn)                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| UX friction         | Open email, copy 6-digit code                   | One tap / biometric (Touch ID, Windows Hello)   |
| Phishing resistance | Vulnerable (codes can be typed into fake sites) | **Immune** — bound to the exact origin (`rpId`) |
| Secrets             | Shared secret stored server-side                | Server stores **public keys only**              |

**Implemented with** `py_webauthn` (webauthn 3.x, Duo Labs) server-side + `@simplewebauthn/browser` client-side. Four DRF endpoints: `passkey/register/begin` → `passkey/register/complete` (JWT-authed), `passkey/login/begin` → `passkey/login/complete` (issues JWTs). Conditional UI (`mediation: 'conditional'`) surfaces passkeys in the browser's native autofill; a manual **"Sign in with a passkey"** button is the fallback. Register/revoke from Dashboard → Security → Passkeys.

**Gotchas handled:** WebAuthn requires a secure origin (`localhost` is fine; IP addresses are not); frontend/backend should share a registrable domain in production (e.g. `app.example.com` + `api.example.com` with `rpId: example.com`); an `AbortController` cancels a pending conditional ceremony when the user submits the password form.

**Tips**

- Sign in with the **username** (e.g. `rahim.hossain`) **or** the email address (e.g. `rahim.hossain@rentora.com`) — both work.
- `rahim.hossain` has a roommate profile — log in and open **Roommates** to see live match scores.
- `tanvir.islam` has listings — open **Dashboard → Fraud** to see the risk cards and try **Re-scan**.
- **Try 2FA:** Dashboard → **Two-Factor Authentication** → **Enable 2FA** (current password → emailed code → save your **recovery codes**). Next sign-in asks for the emailed code (or a recovery code). In development the code prints to the backend console; in production it goes to the account's email.
- **Try passkeys:** Dashboard → Security → **Passkeys** → **Register a passkey** (your device's biometric/PIN), then sign out and use the login page's passkey autofill or the **"Sign in with a passkey"** button.

## 🔄 Team Workflow

- **Branching:** feature work happens on `feature/<name>` branches off `main`; never commit directly to `main`.
- **Pull requests:** every branch ships as a PR against `main`; CI must be green (tests, coverage, lint, build) before merge.
- **Pre-commit:** husky + lint-staged format and lint staged files on every commit.
- **Environments:** local dev (SQLite + runserver) → CI (GitHub Actions) → production (PostgreSQL + Daphne, Phase 8).
